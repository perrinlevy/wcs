                                    This paper presents a new model for understanding human
                                    behavior. In this model (FBM), behavior is a product of three
                                    factors: motivation, ability, and triggers, each of which has
                                    subcomponents. The FBM asserts that for a person to perform a
                                    target behavior, he or she must (1) be sufficiently motivated, (2)
                                    have the ability to perform the behavior, and (3) be triggered to
                                    perform the behavior. These three factors must occur at the same
                                    moment, else the behavior will not happen. The FBM is useful in
                                    analysis and design of persuasive technologies. The FBM also
                                    helps teams work together efficiently because this model gives
                                    people a shared way of thinking about behavior change.

                                    Because of personal motives and the architecture of the mind, it may
                                    be difficult for people to know themselves. People often attempt to block out unwanted
                                    thoughts and feelings through conscious suppression and perhaps through unconscious
                                    repression, though whether such attempts are successful is controversial. A more common
                                    source of self-knowledge failure is the inaccessibility of much of the mind to consciousness,
                                    including mental processes involved in perception, motor learning, personality,
                                    attitudes, and self-esteem. Introspection cannot provide a direct pipeline to these
                                    mental processes, though some types of introspection may help people construct beneficial
                                     personal narratives. Other ways of increasing self-knowledge include looking at
                                    ourselves through the eyes of others and observing our own behavior. These approaches
                                    can potentially promote self-knowledge, although major obstacles exist. It is not always
                                    advantageous to hold self-perceptions that correspond perfectly with reality, but
                                    increasing awareness of nonconscious motives and personality is generally beneficial.

The collapse of sensemaking in organizations: The Mann Gulch disaster

                                    The death of 13 men in the Mann Gulch fire disaster,
                                    made famous in Norman Maclean's Young Men and
                                    Fire, is analyzed as the interactive disintegration of role
                                    structure and sensemaking in a minimal organization.
                                    Four potential sources of resilience that make groups
                                    less vulnerable to disruptions of sensemaking are
                                    proposed to forestall disintegration, including
                                    improvisation, virtual role systems, the attitude of
                                    wisdom, and norms of respectful interaction. The
                                    analysis is then embedded in the organizational literature
                                    to show that we need to reexamine our thinking about
                                    temporary systems, structuration, nondisclosive

                            Elias Canetti's 1981 Nobel Prize was awarded mainly on the basis of this, his masterwork of philosophical anthropology about <i>la condition humaine</i> in a social world. Ranging from soccer crowds and political rallies to Bushmen and the pilgrimage to Mecca, Canetti reviews the way crowds form, develop, and dissolve, using this taxonomy of mass movement as a key to the dynamics of social life.

Expertise in judgment and decision making: A case for training intuitive decision skills

                                    Research on expertise is largely founded on the idea that experts have achieved a rare
                                    proficiency in a domain that most of their peers never quite reach. What is the nature of
                                    such expertise? How does someone become an expert? How do experts differ from
                                    novices? These are questions that have intrigued the vast majority of expertise researchers
                                    (e.g., Chi, Glaser, & Farr, 1988; Ericsson & Smith, 1991). Research on expertise within
                                    the judgment and decision making (JDM) community has been primarily concerned
                                    with quite a different set of issues. What role should experts play in forecasting and
                                    decision support systems? Do experts suffer from the same judgmental biases that have
                                    been demonstrated in undergraduates? How can experts know so much and predict so
                                    badly? (e.g., Camerer & Johnson, 1991; Smith & Kida, 1991; Wright & Bolger, 1993).
                                    There may be value in addressing some of these questions. Nevertheless, the stress in this
                                    chapter is on the former set of issues as they apply to decision making, with the goal of
                                    convincing the reader that such questions deserve a dramatically greater role in JDM
                                    research on expertise than they ordinarily receive. First, however, we address the skeptical
                                    view of expertise implied in some of the JDM questions above.

Personality and the prediction of consequential outcomes

                                    Personality has consequences. Measures of personality have contemporaneous and predictive relations to a variety of important outcomes. Using the Big Five factors as heuristics for organizing the research literature, numerous consequential relations are identified. Personality dispositions are associated with happiness, physical and psychological health, spirituality, and identity at an individual level; associated with the quality of relationships with peers, family, and romantic others at an interpersonal level; and associated with occupational choice, satisfaction, and performance, as well as community involvement, criminal activity, and political ideology at a social institutional level.

                                    People tend to hold overly favorable views of their abilities in many social and intellectual domains. The authors suggest that this overestimation occurs, in part, because people who are unskilled in these domains suffer a dual burden: Not only do these people reach erroneous conclusions and make unfortunate choices, but their incompetence robs them of the metacognitive ability to realize it. Across 4 studies, the authors found that participants scoring in the bottom quartile on tests of humor, grammar, and logic grossly overestimated their test performance and ability. Although their test scores put them in the 12th percentile, they estimated themselves to be in the 62nd. Several analyses linked this miscalibration to deficits in metacognitive skill, or the capacity to distinguish accuracy from error. Paradoxically, improving the skills of participants, and thus increasing their metacognitive competence, helped them recognize the limitations of their abilities.

                                    This article provides a qualitative review of the trait perspective in leadership research, followed by a
                                    meta-analysis. The authors used the five-factor model as an organizing framework and meta-analyzed
                                    222 correlations from 73 samples. Overall, the correlations with leadership were Neuroticism .24, Extraversion .31, Openness to Experience .24, Agreeableness .08, and Conscientiousness .28.
                                    Results indicated that the relations of Neuroticism, Extraversion, Openness to Experience, and Conscientiousness
                                    with leadership generalized in that more than 90% of the individual correlations were greater
                                    than 0. Extraversion was the most consistent correlate of leadership across study settings and leadership
                                    criteria (leader emergence and leadership effectiveness). Overall, the five-factor model had a multiple
                                    correlation of .48 with leadership, indicating strong support for the leader trait perspective when traits are
                                    organized according to the five-factor model.

                            The impact of Eastern thought on the culture of the United States and Western Europe is now seen in the spread of Buddhism, meditation, martial arts, yoga, oriental art, and hundreds of other Asian imports. F. S. C. Northrop in this perceptive work was one of the first Americans to grasp the full significance of Eastern culture, its distinctive features, and its potential for influencing the rest of the world. Written during World War II, this classic work correctly anticipated the clash of eastern and western ideologies which has dominated the post-war landscape.

                                    This review covers recent developments in the social influence literature,
                                    focusing primarily on compliance and conformity research published between
                                    1997 and 2002. The principles and processes underlying a target’s susceptibility to outside
                                    influences are considered in light of three goals fundamental to rewarding human
                                    functioning. Specifically, targets are motivated to form accurate perceptions of reality
                                    and react accordingly, to develop and preserve meaningful social relationships, and to
                                    maintain a favorable self-concept. Consistent with the current movement in compliance
                                    and conformity research, this review emphasizes the ways in which these goals interact
                                    with external forces to engender social influence processes that are subtle, indirect, and
                                    outside of awareness.

Why have large-scale schemes to improve the human condition in the twentieth century so often gone awry? James C. Scott analyzes diverse failures in high-modernist, authoritarian state planning-collectivization in Russia, the building of Brasilia, compulsory <i>ujamaa</i> villages in Tanzania, and others-and uncovers conditions common to all such planning disasters. What these failures teach us, he argues, is that any centrally managed social plan must recognize the importance of local customs and practical knowledge if it hopes to succeed.

                          This article provides a current review of research examining contextual factors that can either foster or hinder employee creativity at the individual, job, group, and organizational level. Specifically, we examine the role of leadership and the use of different human resource practices for developing a work context that is supportive of creativity. Finally, based on our review, we discuss practical implications for managers, propose areas that need further research attention, and highlight possible new directions for future research.

                                    This article extends psychological methods and concepts into a domain that is as profoundly consequential
                                    as it is poorly understood: intelligence analysis. We report findings from a geopolitical forecasting
                                    tournament that assessed the accuracy of more than 150,000 forecasts of 743 participants on 199 events
                                    occurring over 2 years. Participants were above average in intelligence and political knowledge relative
                                    to the general population. Individual differences in performance emerged, and forecasting skills were
                                    surprisingly consistent over time. Key predictors were (a) dispositional variables of cognitive ability,
                                    political knowledge, and open-mindedness; (b) situational variables of training in probabilistic reasoning
                                    and participation in collaborative teams that shared information and discussed rationales (Mellers, Ungar,
                                    et al., 2014); and (c) behavioral variables of deliberation time and frequency of belief updating. We
                                    developed a profile of the best forecasters; they were better at inductive reasoning, pattern detection,
                                    cognitive flexibility, and open-mindedness. They had greater understanding of geopolitics, training in
                                    probabilistic reasoning, and opportunities to succeed in cognitively enriched team environments. Last but
                                    not least, they viewed forecasting as a skill that required deliberate practice, sustained effort, and constant
                                    monitoring of current affairs.

                                    Intuitive predictions follow a judgmental heuristic—representativeness. By
                                    this heuristic, people predict the outcome that appears most representative of
                                    the evidence. Consequently, intuitive predictions are insensitive to the reliability
                                    of the evidence or to the prior probability of the outcome, in violation
                                    of the logic of statistical prediction. The hypothesis that people predict by
                                    representativeness is supported in a series of studies with both naive and sophisticated
                                    subjects. It is shown that the ranking of outcomes by likelihood
                                    coincides with their ranking by representativeness and that people erroneously
                                    predict rare events and extreme values if these happen to be representative.
                                    The experience of unjustified confidence in predictions and the prevalence of
                                    fallacious intuitions concerning statistical regression are traced to the representativeness
                                    heuristic.

                                    People are selfish, yet morally motivated. Morality is universal, yet culturally variable. Such
                                    apparent contradictions are dissolving as research from many disciplines converges on a few
                                    shared principles, including the importance of moral intuitions, the socially functional (rather
                                    than truth-seeking) nature of moral thinking, and the coevolution of moral minds with cultural
                                    practices and institutions that create diverse moral communities. I propose a fourth principle
                                    to guide future research: Morality is about more than harm and fairness. More research is
                                    needed on the collective and religious parts of the moral domain, such as loyalty, authority,
                                    and spiritual purity.

                                    Despite impressive advances in recent years with respect to
                                    theory and research, personality psychology has yet to
                                    articulate clearly a comprehensive framework for understanding
                                    the whole person. In an effort to achieve that aim,
                                    the current article draws on the most promising empirical
                                    and theoretical trends in personality psychology today to
                                    articulate 5big principles for an integrative science of the
                                    whole person. Personality is conceived as (a) an individual’s
                                    unique variation on the general evolutionary design
                                    for human nature, expressed as a developing pattern of (b)
                                    dispositional traits, (c) characteristic adaptations, and (d)
                                    self-defining life narratives, complexly and differentially
                                    situated (e) in culture and social context. The 5principles
                                    suggest a framework for integrating the Big Five model of
                                    personality traits with those self-defining features of psychological
                                    individuality constructed in response to situated

                                    With few exceptions, scholarship on creativity has focused on its positive aspects while
                                    largely ignoring its dark side. This includes not only creativity deliberately aimed at hurting
                                    others, such as crime or terrorism, or at gaining unfair advantages, but also the accidental
                                    negative side effects of well-intentioned acts. This book brings together essays written by

Cultural constraints in management theories

                                    Management as the word is presently used is an American invention. In other parts of the world not only the practices but the entire concept of management may differ, and the theories needed to understand it, may deviate considerably from what is considered normal and desirable in the USA. The reader is invited on a trip around the world, and both local management practices and theories are explained from the different contexts and histories of the places visited: Germany, Japan, France, Holland, the countries of the overseas Chinese, South-East Asia, Africa, Russia, and finally mainland China. A model in which worldwide differences in national cultures are categorized according to five independent dimensions helps in explaining the differences in management found; although the situation in each country or region has unique characteristics that no model can account for. One practical application of the model is in demonstrating the relative position of the U.S. versus other parts of the world. In a global perspective, U.S. management theories contain a number of idiosyncrasies not necessarily shared by management elsewhere. Three such idiosyncrasies are mentioned: a stress on market processes, a stress on the individual, and a focus on managers rather than on workers. A plea is made for an internationalization not only of business, but also of management theories, as a way of enriching theories at the national level.

                                    A theory of the types of values on which cultures can be compared is presented
                                    and validated with data from 49 nations from around the world. Seven types of
                                    values are identified, structured along three polar dimensions: Conservatism
                                    versus Intellectual and Affective Autonomy; Hierarchy versus Egalitarianism;
                                    and Mastery versus Harmony. Based on their cultural value priorities, nations are arrayed in a two-dimensional space, revealing meaningful groupings of
culturally related nations. Analyses replicate with both teacher and student
samples. Implications of national differences in cultural values for differences
in meaning of work are explicated. To stimulate research on cultural values
and work, hypotheses are developed regarding the cultural value emphases
that are especially compatible or conflicting with work centrality, with
different societal norms about work, and with the pursuit of four types of work
values or goals.

                                    goal-setting theory. They describe the core findings of the
                                    theory, the mechanisms by which goals operate, moderators
                                    of goal effects, the relation of goals and satisfaction,

This publication, based on 2 years of fieldwork (1978-1980), focuses on the local class relations in a small (70 households) rice farming community in the main paddy-growing area of Kedah in Malaysia. Introduction of the Green Revolution in 1976 eliminated 2/3 of the wage-earning opportunities for smallholders and landless labourers. The main ensuing class struggle is analysed being the ideological struggle in the village and the practise of resistance itself consisting of: footdragging, dissimulation, desertion, false compliance, pilfering, feigned ignorance and sabotage acts. Rich and poor are engaged in an unremitting if silent struggle to define changes in land tenure, mechanization and employment to advance their own interests, and to use values that they share to control the distribution of status, land, work and grain.

The connections between affect and decision making: Nine resulting phenomena

                                    The psychological study of decision making has long drawn on the tension between
                                    normative and descriptive considerations. Because normative accounts, such as expected
                                    utility, predate descriptive inquiry, this approach has produced a research program that
                                    is to some extent inherently conservative. First, the experimental agenda has often been
                                    molded by a desire to improve upon the older normative theories. A common tactic is
                                    to isolate some normative requirement that seems likely to fail empirically and to conduct
                                    experiments corroborating this failure. Second, descriptively-inspired theories have
                                    avoided sweeping changes in favor of maintaining agreement with the broad themes of
                                    normative accounts. Kahneman and Tversky’s prospect theory, which is the best-known
                                    descriptively-inspired theory, provides an example

My emphasis will be mainly on prescriptive strategies that individuals themselves can adopt, as opposed to techniques used by external agents to modify the decision environment. An example of the former approach would be increasing retirement savings by training people on the principle of compounding, either abstractly or as a rule of thumb (e.g., "the rule of 72"--an investment that grows at X percent per year will double roughly every 72/X years). An example of the latter approach is Thaler and Benartzi's (2001) highly successful demonstration that organizations can rebias employees to save more by changing the status quo and by exploiting mental accounting. Both rebiasing (using one bias to offset another) and changing the decision environment are viable methods for debiasing. However, I will focus on equipping individuals with strategies because this approach tends to increase their decision skills and their ability to apply those skills to new decision domains (in this example, perhaps, college savings).

Ontological uncertainty and innovation

                                    This paper is about the relationship between uncertainty and innovation. In particular, it raises
                                    and responds to two questions: what are innovating agents uncertain about, and how does their
                                    uncertainty affect how they act? In section 1, we explain what we mean by innovation, with the
                                    help of an example to which we refer throughout the paper. In section 2, after some preliminary
                                    considerations on the relation between temporality and action, we describe a way of thinking about
                                    uncertainty. This idea leads to a distinction between three kinds of uncertainty: truth uncertainty,
                                    semantic uncertainty, and ontological uncertainty. Of the three, ontological uncertainty is the least
                                    discussed in the economic literature, but we argue that it is essential for understanding innovation
                                    processes.

                                    theories, which means that most of what passes for
                                    theory in organizational studies consists of approximations.
                                    Although these approximations vary in their generality, few
                                    of them take the form of strong theory, and most of them
                                    can be read as texts created "in lieu of" strong theories.
                                    These substitutes for theory may result from lazy theorizing
                                    in which people try to graft theory onto stark sets of data.
                                    But they may also represent interim struggles in which
                                    people intentionally inch toward stronger theories. The
                                    products of laziness and intense struggles may look the
                                    same and may consist of references, data, lists, diagrams,
                                    and hypotheses. To label these five as "not theory" makes
                                    sense if the problem is laziness and incompetence. But
                                    ruling out those same five may slow inquiry if the problem is
                                    theoretical development still in its early stages, Sutton and
                                    Staw know this. But it gets lost in their concern with theory
                                    as a product rather than as a process. To add complication
                                    and nuance to their message, I want to focus on the
                                    process of theorizing.

This paper presents a broad overview of the expressive writing paradigm. Since its first use in the 1980s, dozens of studies have explored the parameters and boundary conditions of its effectiveness. In the laboratory, consistent and significant health improvements are found when individuals write or talk about personally upsetting experiences. The effects include both subjective and objective markers of health and well-being. The disclosure phenomenon appears to generalize across settings, many individual difference factors, and several Western cultures, and is independent of social feedback.

                                    Recent years have seen a rebirth of cultural research in psychology. Although the cultural
                                    foundations of the human mind have been recognized from very early years in psychology
                                    (e.g., Wundt, 1916), the attempt to explore the interplay between culture and mind
                                    has rarely received the level of recognition and popularity that it does now. In social
                                    psychology, for example, a growing amount of recent published research about topics
                                    such as self, self-esteem, attribution, and motivation, includes either cross-cultural data
                                    directly or, at least, some discussions and speculations about the cross-cultural implications
                                    of their findings (Fiske, Kitayama, Markus, & Nisbett, 1998; Heine, Lehman, Markus,
                                    & Kitayama, 1999; Markus & Kitayama, 1991; Nisbett, Peng, Choi & Norenzayan,
                                    2001). The cultural zeitgeist in social psychology is significant, not because all social psychologists
                                    study cross-cultural issues but because they are all expected to have a cultural
                                    perspective (Miller, 2001)

The now-classic Metaphors We Live By changed our understanding of metaphor and its role in language and the mind. Metaphor, the authors explain, is a fundamental mechanism of mind, one that allows us to use what we know about our physical and social experience to provide understanding of countless other subjects. Because such metaphors structure our most basic understandings of our experience, they are "metaphors we live by"--metaphors that can shape our perceptions and actions without our ever noticing them. In this updated edition of Lakoff and Johnson's influential book, the authors supply an afterword surveying how their theory of metaphor has developed within the cognitive sciences to become central to the contemporary understanding of how we think and how we express our thoughts in language.

In developing managerial competencies it's not enough to "look in the rear view mirror", project past trends, and just do what's worked in the past. It's crucial to look ahead, and position for the future. In today's world competence rests in our attitudes, values and mindsets, not just in technical skills.

Major accidents keep occurring that seem preventable and that have similar systemic causes. Too often, we fail to learn from the past and make inadequate changes in response to losses. Examining the assumptions and paradigms underlying safety engineering may help identify the problem. The assumptions questioned in this paper involve four different areas: definitions of safety and its relationship to reliability, accident causality models, retrospective vs. prospective analysis, and operator error. Alternatives based on systems thinking are proposed.

Creativity and innovation in any organization are vital to its successful performance. The authors review the rapidly growing body of research in this area with particular attention to the period 2002 to 2013, inclusive. Conceiving of both creativity and innovation as being integral parts of essentially the same process, we propose a new, integrative definition. We note that research into creativity has typically examined the stage of idea generation, whereas innovation studies have commonly also included the latter phase of idea implementation. The authors discuss several seminal theories of creativity and innovation and then apply a comprehensive levels-of-analysis framework to review extant research into individual, team, organizational, and multilevel innovation. Key measurement characteristics of the reviewed studies are then noted. In conclusion, we propose a guiding framework for future research comprising 11 major themes and 60 specific questions for future studies.

Innovation is defined as a process that is fraught with uncertainty. This article’s aim is to diminish lack of knowledge of the factors that create uncertainty in innovation processes. The basic thrust of the present argument is that the potential value integral to innovation may or may not be materialized in the future. Given that the future entails uncertainty, it is reasonable to expect that uncertainty is inherent in every innovation process. Uncertainty results from the fact that, on the one hand, events in the future do not follow the course of past events, and, on the other, knowledge of the future is always incomplete. Using a systematic approach to reviewing the literature, eight factors which create uncertainty in processes of innovation were identified, namely: technological uncertainty, market uncertainty, regulatory/institutional uncertainty, social/political uncertainty, acceptance/legitimacy uncertainty, managerial uncertainty, timing uncertainty, and consequence uncertainty.

People in different cultures have strikingly different construals of the self, of others, and of the interdependence of the 2. These construals can influence, and in many cases determine, the very nature of individual experience, including cognition, emotion, and motivation. Many Asian cultures have distinct conceptions of individuality that insist on the fundamental relatedness of individuals to each other. The emphasis is on attending to others, fitting in, and harmonious interdependence with them. American culture neither assumes nor values such an overt connectedness among individuals. In contrast, individuals seek to maintain their independence from others by attending to the self and by discovering and expressing their unique inner attributes. As proposed herein, these construals are even more powerful than previously imagined. Theories of the self from both psychology and anthropology are integrated to define in detail the difference between a construal of the self as independent and a construal of the self as interdependent. Each of these divergent construals should have a set of specific consequences for cognition, emotion, and motivation; these consequences are proposed and relevant empirical literature is reviewed.

Most investigations of creativity tend to take one of two directions: everyday creativity (also called “little-c”), which can be found in nearly all people, and eminent creativity (also called “Big-C”), which is reserved for the great. In this paper, the authors propose a Four C model of creativity that expands this dichotomy. Specifically, the authors add the idea of “mini-c,” creativity inherent in the learning process, and Pro-c, the developmental and effortful progression beyond little-c that represents professional-level expertise in any creative area. The authors include different transitions and gradations of these four dimensions of creativity, and then discuss advantages and examples of the Four C Model.

                                    Every biography of a creative person tries to explain the achievements of its
                                    subject in light of a more or less implicit dynamic theory of life-span development.
                                    The interest, curiosity, and enduring engagement of the artist or scientist
                                    are seen to follow from a series of meaningfully connected experiences
                                    stretching from childhood to maturity and old age. For instance, in his classic
                                    biography of da Vinci, Freud (1947) traced Leonardo’s lifelong curiosity,
                                    masked by a dispassionate analytic detachment, to the earliest years of his life,
                                    when as an illegitimate child he was left motherless in his father’s household.
                                    In his biography of Martin Luther, Erik Erikson (1958) hinted at the roots of
                                    Luther’s stubborn rebelliousness to authority by tracing them to an unforgiving
                                    father and a loving but powerless mother. [...]

                                    Forecasting involves making predictions about an unknown question or issue. My focus
                                    here is on why uncertainty and complexity pose special challenges in forecasting and
                                    what to do about this.

Milieus of creativity: The role of places, environments, and spatial contexts
                                  </h2>

                                    Although some of the earliest case studies on famous scientists addressed the
                                    importance of parents, peer groups, teachers, and fortuitous events for creative persons
                                    (e.g., Candolle, 1873; Ellis, 1926; Ostwald, 1909), interactions with the environment
                                    did not figure in the first theoretical conceptions of creativity. Researchers
                                    claimed that creative persons are gifted with special innate talents and capacities
                                    that others lack and that creativity is a gift or innate talent that cannot be acquired
                                    or taught (see Boden, 2004, pp. 14–15). This concept eventually raised a number of
                                    questions. For example, why are highly creative individuals not evenly distributed
                                    over time and space? Why are certain cities and historical periods characterized
                                    by great creativity in the visual arts, music, and science, whereas others are not?
                                    Why are certain research departments or universities so successful at copiously
                                    producing outstanding creative scientists, whereas others are not? Why does the
                                    large majority of Nobel Prize winners stem from such a small share of universities?
                                    Reflecting growing interest in the social environment as a variable, these questions
                                    indicated a change in creativity research. [...]
